Our program:
- The code we created takes height in inches from a user as well as their name.
- Measurement given is converted to feet in inches. ex: 72 in -> 6' 0"
- Prints out: (name) is (feet' inches") tall.
- This code allows for exact measurements in inches to be converted to real life measurments. If someone asks you your height, you wouldn't say 60 inches if you were 5 feet tall, this program solves that problem. 
- Simple uses of user input, division, and the modulus function were implemented within the program.
